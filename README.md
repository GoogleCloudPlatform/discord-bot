# GenAI Discord Bot

This repository hosts source code for a Discord bot using various Google Cloud AI-related products.

## Getting started

To run the bot, you will need access to [Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk-ref). The Vertex library will make use of the 
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries).

The bot also requires you to set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environmental variable to contain the secret token generated
for your bot in the Discord Developer portal. Learn more about setting up your first application/bot from 
[Discord documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

## Vertex AI API Terms of Service

To execute the code of the bot, you need to have access to Vertex AI API. That's possible
only once you accept [Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms) . Please remember 
about those terms if you expose the bot to other users on your Discord server.
